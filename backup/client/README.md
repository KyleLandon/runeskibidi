# Client Folder

This folder contains all client-side (browser) code for the Runeskibidi MMO project.

## Structure
- `core/` - Core game logic (Game, Player, World, Camera)
- `managers/` - Game managers (Network, Auth, UI, Input)
- `config/` - Client-side configuration (Supabase, etc.)
- `styles/` - CSS and style assets
- `main.js` - Main entry point for the client
- `index.html` - Main HTML file for the client

## Usage
- All files in `src/` should be moved here for a clean client/server split.
